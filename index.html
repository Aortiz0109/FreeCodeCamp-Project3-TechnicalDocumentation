        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            QuantumScript supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and quantum-specific operators. Arithmetic operators enable developers to perform mathematical computations on classical variables and quantum states. Comparison operators facilitate the comparison of values, while logical operators allow for the construction of complex conditional statements and Boolean operations.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical computations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
            </li>

        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            QuantumScript supports traditional control flow constructs such as "<strong>if</strong>" statements, "<strong>for</strong>" loops, "<strong>while</strong>" loops, and "<strong>switch</strong>" statements. These constructs empower developers to write expressive and concise code that can adapt to different scenarios and input conditions.

        <p>
            QuantumScript supports both built-in functions provided by the language and user-defined functions created by developers. Built-in functions offer predefined functionality for common quantum operations and computations, while user-defined functions enable developers to define custom behaviors tailored to their specific needs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Built-in Functions: Predefined functions provided by QuantumScript for common quantum operations and computations.</li>

        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Scoping in QuantumScript refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of a program. QuantumScript follows lexical scoping rules, where the scope of a variable is determined by its location within the code. Variables declared within a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it, promoting encapsulation and preventing unintended side effects.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Local Scope: Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function's scope.</li>
            <li>Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function are accessible from anywhere within the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
        <code>
            // Example QuantumScript scoping
            let globalVariable = 10;

            function myFunction() {
                let localVariable = 20;
                console.log(globalVariable); // Access global variable
                console.log(localVariable); // Access local variable
            }

            myFunction(); // Call the function
            console.log(globalVariable); // Access global variable
            console.log(localVariable); // Error: localVariable is not defined
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            Functions and scoping mechanisms in QuantumScript enable developers to write modular, maintainable code that promotes code reuse and fosters clear program structure. By leveraging functions and understanding scoping rules, developers can build complex quantum algorithms with ease and confidence.

        <p>
            In QuantumScript, arrays and objects are versatile data structures used to organize and manipulate data efficiently. Arrays allow developers to store collections of values, while objects enable the grouping of related data and functionality into cohesive units. These data structures play a crucial role in managing complex quantum computations and organizing program data effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            Arrays and objects in QuantumScript empower developers to structure and manipulate data effectively, enabling the implementation of complex quantum algorithms with clarity and precision. By leveraging these data structures, developers can organize program data, streamline algorithm implementation, and build scalable and maintainable quantum applications.

        <p>
            Error handling in QuantumScript provides mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations and exceptional conditions that may arise during program execution. By detecting and managing errors effectively, developers can ensure the reliability and robustness of their quantum applications.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
            // Example QuantumScript try-catch block

        <p>
            QuantumScript supports the "<strong>try-catch</strong>" mechanism for catching and handling errors that occur within a specified block of code. When an error occurs within the "<strong>try</strong>" block, control is transferred to the corresponding "<strong>catch</strong>" block, allowing developers to handle the error gracefully and prevent program termination.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try-Catch Blocks: Enclose a block of code that may potentially throw an error, with an associated "<strong>catch</strong>" block to handle any errors that occur within the "<strong>try</strong>" block.</li>

        </pre>
        <p>
            Developers can also throw custom errors using the "<strong>throw</strong>" statement, providing descriptive error messages to aid in debugging and troubleshooting. Custom errors allow developers to communicate specific error conditions and guide users towards resolving them effectively.
